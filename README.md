# COMP3015 Coursework 2


A submission for an openGl coursework, featuring custom shading techniques, lighting, and texturing.

Usability: 
There is no interaction with the exe file, nor the runtime application in VS.

How does it work:
the architecture has mostly been given as a boilerplate, header files often containing all required variables, with the exception of the shaders, which there are multiple of, but only one set is ever used at a time.

Background:
The project has started from the original project files given to us on the DLE during one of the  starter lab sessions, as setting up a project from scratch did not prove fruitful. The classes used mostly follow the base architecture, with used shaders being placed in the shaders folder, and all textures and objects found in the media folder.
